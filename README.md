Big numbers or numbers as a string


This current class is for testing only. It's not finished because I'm already working on a new enhanced version. Do not use this class in software projects in any way.

If you want to support this project, you can buy the book
NAAS - numbers and a string from here

where you can learn more about PHP arrays and how to use numbers as strings. From the book you can find algorithms to sort and compare the arrays.
